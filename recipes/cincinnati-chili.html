        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Authentic Cincinnati Chili is a meaty, rich, and uniquely spiced chili from (you guessed it!) Cincinnati, Ohio. It's served over hot spaghetti with your choice of toppings. Don’t forget the cheese and oyster crackers!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef (80:20 is good)</li>
            <li>1 (6-0unce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 large onion minced (about 3 cups)</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1/4 ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worchester sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the tomato paste: Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the tomato paste to the dry pot and cook, constantly scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, until the tomato smells rich and toasty and you start to see browned (not burned) patches in the bottom of the pot. This should take 1 to 3 minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Combine the ingredients in a pot:
                Remove the pot from heat and add the ground beef and water. Mix them together into a sludge. It will not look pretty, but press on. There's a method to this madness.
                
                Return to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring all the while, so the sludge breaks up into a mealy paste. Add all the remaining ingredients except the vinegar and chocolate.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Simmer gently, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours:
                Stir the chili often. You want the volume to reduce a bit. (To be honest, just one hour of cook time is okay, but for optimal chili-ness, go long.)
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate overnight:
                Refrigerate in an air-tight covered container. (Note: you can eat the chili immediately if you want to.)
            </li><br>
            <li>
                De-fat the chili:
                The next day, lift or scrape off any solidified fat from the top of the chili and discard.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Warm and serve:
                Bring to a rapid simmer, then add the vinegar and chocolate. (The chocolate won’t make it taste sweet—it adds a hint of sophisticated complexity and acts as a foil for all those spices.)
                
                Serve any “way” (see headnotes). The chili will also keep refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to a year.
