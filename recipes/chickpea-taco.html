        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dry chickpeas thoroughly on a clean kitchen towel. Be sure to remove as much water as possible so the oil doesn't splatter when you add them to the pan.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pan over medium heat.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                Add chickpeas to the pan and cook, stirring frequently for 10 minutes.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                Add chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, along with a couple pinches of salt and pepper and the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                Toss to coat the chickpeas evenly.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                Then cook for another minute or two until the chickpeas are crispy.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                Serve with flour tortillas, Cilantro Lime Slaw, vegan sour cream, and Cotija.
