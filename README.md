This project showcases the HTML I know so far. From the absolute link of the book image to the three relative links to the upcoming recipes I'll be making, the homepage is a well-rounded demonstration of my current abilities in HTML.

Each recipe page showcases the basic HTML principle of relative links with the recipe image and the link back to the homepage. The recipe template also shows off my knowledge of headers, paragraphs, and unordered and ordered lists.
